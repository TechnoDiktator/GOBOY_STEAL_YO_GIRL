In scenarios where multiple Goroutines are accessing and potentially modifying shared resources protected by a single semaphore with a counter, ensuring there are no race conditions requires careful coordination and synchronization. Here's how you can address this:

Mutual Exclusion: Ensure that only one Goroutine at a time can access or modify the shared resources by using the semaphore as a mutex. When a Goroutine wants to access the shared resource, it acquires the semaphore. Only when the semaphore counter is greater than zero can the Goroutine proceed. After finishing its work with the shared resource, it releases the semaphore.

Critical Section: Define critical sections where shared resources are accessed or modified. Enclose the code that accesses or modifies shared resources within locks acquired by the semaphore. This ensures that only one Goroutine can execute the critical section at a time, preventing race conditions.

Atomic Operations: If operations on shared variables within critical sections are simple, consider using atomic operations or atomic types from the sync/atomic package. These operations are guaranteed to be performed atomically without interruption from other Goroutines, preventing race conditions.

Avoiding Deadlocks: Be mindful of potential deadlocks that can occur if multiple Goroutines acquire semaphores in different orders. To prevent deadlocks, establish a consistent order in which semaphores are acquired across Goroutines.

Testing: Thoroughly test your concurrent code to identify and address any race conditions or synchronization issues. Techniques such as stress testing and race condition detection tools (go test -race) can help uncover potential issues.

By carefully coordinating access to shared resources using semaphores and applying proper synchronization techniques, you can prevent race conditions and ensure the correctness of your concurrent Go programs.
